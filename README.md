Virtual Assistant Project by Vansh Rathore

This Python-based virtual assistant is designed to perform a range of tasks through voice commands. Utilizing six key libraries—speechrecognition, pywhatkit, pyttsx3, datetime, wikipedia, and pyjokes—the assistant can recognize and execute user instructions. It is capable of tasks like playing music, searching Wikipedia, providing current time and date, making online searches, and telling jokes, all while responding in a synthesized voice. This project demonstrates a solid application of Python in building practical, interactive tools for daily use.

My project is a virtual assistant aimed at creating an interactive, voice-powered library. It combines several powerful Python libraries to make the assistant both informative and entertaining.

1] SpeechRecognition: Allows the assistant to understand and process spoken commands from users, making interaction seamless and intuitive.

2] pywhatkit: Adds a unique layer to the assistant by enabling it to send messages via WhatsApp, search on YouTube, or perform other automated tasks using simple commands.

3] pyttsx3: Enables text-to-speech functionality, allowing the assistant to provide spoken feedback or narrate information, enhancing accessibility and user engagement.

4] datetime: Incorporates date and time functionalities, allowing the assistant to respond to time-related queries or schedule tasks.

5] Wikipedia: Allows the assistant to fetch summaries from Wikipedia, providing instant access to vast amounts of information for user queries.

6] pyjokes: Adds an element of fun to the assistant by delivering jokes, making the interaction not only informative but also entertaining.
